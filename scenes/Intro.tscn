text = "In an age before memory,  
heroes rose from dungeon dustâ€”  
only to be forgotten.

Their fates lost to rot, ruin...  
and something worse.

From the broken code of a failed world,  
**The Bitlord** was born.  

A glitch in the fabric of fate.  
A tyrant of corrupted dreams.

He feeds on failed quests.  
He rewrites history in static and shadow.

You are the last echo  
of a hero who never reached level 20.

No gods. No guides. No second save.

Just rage.  
And a blade of pixel light.

Reclaim your legacy.  
Before the Bitlord deletes it for good.
